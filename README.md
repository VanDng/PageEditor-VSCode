# Package

1/ Make sure the necessary libraries belongs to the `dependencies` section, not `devDependencies`. Otherwise, the extension won't work after installing.

If a library sits on a wrong seat, uninstall it with the command `npm uninstall <lib-name>` and then install it again with the command `npm install <lib-name>` (alright, no flag!) on the root directory of the extension.

2/ Install vsce package with the command `npm install -g vsce`, the `-g` flag is a shorthand for the global configuration which sets the package install location to the folder where you installed NodeJS, so do not care about where you run the command.

3/ On the root directory of the extension, run the command `vsce package`. When the command completes, the package of the extension will be dropped at the root directory.
